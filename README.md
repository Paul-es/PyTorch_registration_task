```
pytest test.py
```
to test if your code works.

## Steps
1. Create a private repo in your github. 
2. Copy the code of ```main.py```, ```test.py``` and ```setup.py``` to corresponding ```main.py```, ```test.py``` and ```setup.py``` in your private repo.
3. Run ```python setup.py install``` for installing numpy and pytest
4. Finish the LinearRegression class.
5. Invite [Gopi](github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar) to your repo.
